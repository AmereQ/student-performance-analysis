# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

A complete data science pipeline project to explore and predict student exam outcomes using machine learning.  
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes demographic and behavioral data.

> **Project Status:** In development 🚧  

---

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze the factors that influence student performance and build a classification model to predict whether a student is likely to pass (score ≥ 10) or fail.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.10+
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 📌 Workflow

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Create binary classification target (`pass_fail`)
- Visualize and explore features
- Train Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluate model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Plot feature importance

---

## 🧪 Results (example)

- Accuracy: ~**82–86%**
- Most important features: `absences`, `failures`, `age`, `studytime`

**Example visualizations:**
- Distribution of final grades (G3)
- Confusion Matrix
- Top 10 Feature Importances
